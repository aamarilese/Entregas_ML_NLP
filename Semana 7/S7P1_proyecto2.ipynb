    "El propósito de este proyecto es que puedan poner en práctica, en sus respectivos grupos de trabajo, sus conocimientos sobre técnicas de preprocesamiento, modelos predictivos de NLP, y la disponibilización de modelos. Para su desarrollo tengan en cuenta las instrucciones dadas en la \"Guía del proyecto 2: Clasificación de género de películas\"\n",

    "\n",
    "Para hacer la entrega, deberán adjuntar el informe autocontenido en PDF a la actividad de entrega del proyecto que encontrarán en la semana 8, y subir el archivo de predicciones a la [competencia de Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/t/2c54d005f76747fe83f77fbf8b3ec232)."

    "En este proyecto se usará un conjunto de datos de géneros de películas. Cada observación contiene el título de una película, su año de lanzamiento, la sinopsis o plot de la película (resumen de la trama) y los géneros a los que pertenece (una película puede pertenercer a más de un género). Por ejemplo:\n",
    "- Título: 'How to Be a Serial Killer'\n",
    "- Plot: 'A serial killer decides to teach the secrets of his satisfying career to a video store clerk.'\n",
    "- Generos: 'Comedy', 'Crime', 'Horror'\n",
